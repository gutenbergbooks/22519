<h2>CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY.</h2>


<p>The little girl came into her papa's
study, as she always did Saturday morning
before breakfast, and asked for a
story. He tried to beg off that morning,
for he was very busy, but she would not
let him. So he began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, once there was a little pig&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hand over his mouth and
stopped him at the word. She said she
had heard little pig-stories till she was
perfectly sick of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what kind of story <i>shall</i> I tell,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Christmas. It's getting to be
the season. It's past Thanksgiving already.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; her papa argued,
&ldquo;that I've told as often about Christmas
as I have about little pigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No difference! Christmas is more
interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Her papa roused himself from
his writing by a great effort. &ldquo;Well,
then, I'll tell you about the little girl
that wanted it Christmas every day in
the year. How would you like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First-rate!&rdquo; said the little girl; and
she nestled into comfortable shape in
his lap, ready for listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, this little pig&mdash;Oh,
what are you pounding me for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you said little pig instead
of little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what's the
difference between a little pig and a
little girl that wanted it Christmas every
day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said the little girl, warningly,
&ldquo;if you don't go on, I'll <i>give</i> it to
you!&rdquo; And at this her papa darted off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
like lightning, and began to tell the
story as fast as he could.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, once there was a little girl who
liked Christmas so much that she wanted
it to be Christmas every day in the
year; and as soon as Thanksgiving was
over she began to send postal-cards to
the old Christmas Fairy to ask if she
mightn't have it. But the old fairy
never answered any of the postals; and
after a while the little girl found out
that the Fairy was pretty particular, and
wouldn't notice anything but letters&mdash;not
even correspondence cards in envelopes;
but real letters on sheets of paper,
and sealed outside with a monogram&mdash;or
your initial, anyway. So, then, she
began to send her letters; and in about
three weeks&mdash;or just the day before
Christmas, it was&mdash;she got a letter from
the Fairy, saying she might have it
Christmas every day for a year, and then
they would see about having it longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl was a good deal excited
already, preparing for the old-fashioned,
once-a-year Christmas that was coming
the next day, and perhaps the Fairy's
promise didn't make such an impression
on her as it would have made at some
other time. She just resolved to keep it
to herself, and surprise everybody with
it as it kept coming true; and then it
slipped out of her mind altogether.</p>

<p>She had a splendid Christmas. She
went to bed early, so as to let Santa
Claus have a chance at the stockings,
and in the morning she was up the first
of anybody and went and felt them, and
found hers all lumpy with packages of
candy, and oranges and grapes, and
pocket-books and rubber balls, and all
kinds of small presents, and her big
brother's with nothing but the tongs in
them, and her young lady sister's with
a new silk umbrella, and her papa's and
mamma's with potatoes and pieces of coal
wrapped up in tissue-paper, just as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
always had every Christmas. Then she
waited around till the rest of the family
were up, and she was the first to burst
into the library, when the doors were
opened, and look at the large presents
laid out on the library-table&mdash;books, and
portfolios, and boxes of stationery, and
breastpins, and dolls, and little stoves,
and dozens of handkerchiefs, and ink-stands,
and skates, and snow-shovels,
and photograph-frames, and little easels,
and boxes of water-colors, and Turkish
paste, and nougat, and candied cherries,
and dolls' houses, and waterproofs&mdash;and
the big Christmas-tree, lighted and standing
in a waste-basket in the middle.</p>

<p>She had a splendid Christmas all day.
She ate so much candy that she did not
want any breakfast; and the whole forenoon
the presents kept pouring in that
the expressman had not had time to deliver
the night before; and she went
round giving the presents she had got
for other people, and came home and ate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
turkey and cranberry for dinner, and
plum-pudding and nuts and raisins and
oranges and more candy, and then went
out and coasted, and came in with a
stomach-ache, crying; and her papa
said he would see if his house was turned
into that sort of fool's paradise another
year; and they had a light supper,
and pretty early everybody went to
bed cross.</p></div>

<p>Here the little girl pounded her papa
in the back, again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what now? Did I say pigs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made them <i>act</i> like pigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, didn't they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter; you oughtn't to put it
into a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I'll take it all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father went on:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The little girl slept very heavily, and
she slept very late, but she was wakened
at last by the other children dancing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
round her bed with their stockings full
of presents in their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the little girl, and
she rubbed her eyes and tried to rise up
in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!&rdquo;
they all shouted, and waved their stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! It was Christmas yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her brothers and sisters just laughed.
&ldquo;We don't know about that. It's Christmas
to-day, anyway. You come into
the library and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then all at once it flashed on the little
girl that the Fairy was keeping her
promise, and her year of Christmases
was beginning. She was dreadfully
sleepy, but she sprang up like a lark&mdash;a
lark that had overeaten itself and gone
to bed cross&mdash;and darted into the library.
There it was again! Books, and portfolios,
and boxes of stationery, and
breastpins&mdash;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn't go over it all, papa; I
guess I can remember just what was
there,&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, and there was the Christmas-tree
blazing away, and the family picking
out their presents, but looking pretty
sleepy, and her father perfectly puzzled,
and her mother ready to cry. &ldquo;I'm sure
I don't see how I'm to dispose of all
these things,&rdquo; said her mother, and her
father said it seemed to him they had
had something just like it the day before,
but he supposed he must have
dreamed it. This struck the little girl
as the best kind of a joke; and so she
ate so much candy she didn't want any
breakfast, and went round carrying
presents, and had turkey and cranberry
for dinner, and then went out and coasted,
and came in with a&mdash;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you promise, you forgetful
thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh yes!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, the next day, it was just the
same thing over again, but everybody
getting crosser; and at the end of a
week's time so many people had lost
their tempers that you could pick up
lost tempers anywhere; they perfectly
strewed the ground. Even when people
tried to recover their tempers they usually
got somebody else's, and it made
the most dreadful mix.</p>

<p>The little girl began to get frightened,
keeping the secret all to herself; she
wanted to tell her mother, but she didn't
dare to; and she was ashamed to ask the
Fairy to take back her gift, it seemed
ungrateful and ill-bred, and she thought
she would try to stand it, but she hardly
knew how she could, for a whole year.
So it went on and on, and it was Christmas
on St. Valentine's Day and Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ington's
Birthday, just the same as any
day, and it didn't skip even the First
of April, though everything was counterfeit
that day, and that was some <i>little</i>
relief.</p>

<p>After a while coal and potatoes began
to be awfully scarce, so many had been
wrapped up in tissue-paper to fool papas
and mammas with. Turkeys got to be
about a thousand dollars apiece&mdash;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're beginning to fib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>two</i> thousand, then.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And they got to passing off almost
anything for turkeys&mdash;half-grown humming-birds,
and even rocs out of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>&mdash;the real turkeys were
so scarce. And cranberries&mdash;well, they
asked a diamond apiece for cranberries.
All the woods and orchards were cut
down for Christmas-trees, and where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the woods and orchards used to be it
looked just like a stubble-field, with the
stumps. After a while they had to
make Christmas-trees out of rags, and
stuff them with bran, like old-fashioned
dolls; but there were plenty of rags, because
people got so poor, buying presents
for one another, that they couldn't
get any new clothes, and they just wore
their old ones to tatters. They got so
poor that everybody had to go to the
poor-house, except the confectioners, and
the fancy-store keepers, and the picture-book
sellers, and the expressmen; and
<i>they</i> all got so rich and proud that they
would hardly wait upon a person when
he came to buy. It was perfectly shameful!</p>

<p>Well, after it had gone on about three
or four months, the little girl, whenever
she came into the room in the morning
and saw those great ugly, lumpy stockings
dangling at the fire-place, and the
disgusting presents around everywhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
used to just sit down and burst out crying.
In six months she was perfectly
exhausted; she couldn't even cry any
more; she just lay on the lounge and
rolled her eyes and panted. About the
beginning of October she took to sitting
down on dolls wherever she found them&mdash;French
dolls, or any kind&mdash;she hated
the sight of them so; and by Thanksgiving
she was crazy, and just slammed
her presents across the room.</p>

<p>By that time people didn't carry presents
around nicely any more. They flung
them over the fence, or through the
window, or anything; and, instead of
running their tongues out and taking
great pains to write &ldquo;For dear Papa,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Susie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sammie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Billie,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Bobbie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jennie,&rdquo; or
whoever it was, and troubling to get the
spelling right, and then signing their
names, and &ldquo;Xmas, 18&mdash;,&rdquo; they used
to write in the gift-books, &ldquo;Take it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
you horrid old thing!&rdquo; and then go and
bang it against the front door. Nearly
everybody had built barns to hold their
presents, but pretty soon the barns overflowed,
and then they used to let them
lie out in the rain, or anywhere. Sometimes
the police used to come and tell
them to shovel their presents off the
sidewalk, or they would arrest them.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said everybody had
gone to the poor-house,&rdquo; interrupted the
little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did go, at first,&rdquo; said her papa;
&ldquo;but after a while the poor-houses got
so full that they had to send the people
back to their own houses. They tried
to cry, when they got back, but they
couldn't make the least sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why couldn't they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they had lost their voices,
saying &lsquo;Merry Christmas&rsquo; so much. Did
I tell you how it was on the Fourth of
July?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; how was it?&rdquo; And the little
girl nestled closer, in expectation of
something uncommon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, the night before, the boys stayed
up to celebrate, as they always do, and
fell asleep before twelve o'clock, as usual,
expecting to be wakened by the bells
and cannon. But it was nearly eight
o'clock before the first boy in the United
States woke up, and then he found out
what the trouble was. As soon as he
could get his clothes on he ran out of
the house and smashed a big cannon-torpedo
down on the pavement; but it
didn't make any more noise than a damp
wad of paper; and after he tried about
twenty or thirty more, he began to pick
them up and look at them. Every single
torpedo was a big raisin! Then he
just streaked it up-stairs, and examined
his fire-crackers and toy-pistol and two-dollar
collection of fireworks, and found
that they were nothing but sugar and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
candy painted up to look like fireworks!
Before ten o'clock every boy in the
United States found out that his Fourth
of July things had turned into Christmas
things; and then they just sat down
and cried&mdash;they were so mad. There
are about twenty million boys in the
United States, and so you can imagine
what a noise they made. Some men
got together before night, with a little
powder that hadn't turned into purple
sugar yet, and they said they would fire
off <i>one</i> cannon, anyway. But the cannon
burst into a thousand pieces, for it
was nothing but rock-candy, and some
of the men nearly got killed. The
Fourth of July orations all turned into
Christmas carols, and when anybody
tried to read the Declaration, instead
of saying, &ldquo;When in the course of
human events it becomes necessary,&rdquo;
he was sure to sing, &ldquo;God rest you,
merry gentlemen.&rdquo; It was perfectly
awful.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl drew a deep sigh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how was it at Thanksgiving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her papa hesitated. &ldquo;Well, I'm almost
afraid to tell you. I'm afraid you'll
think it's wicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell, anyway,&rdquo; said the little
girl.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, before it came Thanksgiving it
had leaked out who had caused all these
Christmases. The little girl had suffered
so much that she had talked about it
in her sleep; and after that hardly anybody
would play with her. People just
perfectly despised her, because if it had
not been for her greediness it wouldn't
have happened; and now, when it came
Thanksgiving, and she wanted them to
go to church, and have squash-pie and
turkey, and show their gratitude, they
said that all the turkeys had been eaten
up for her old Christmas dinners, and
if she would stop the Christmases, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
would see about the gratitude. Wasn't
it dreadful? And the very next day
the little girl began to send letters to
the Christmas Fairy, and then telegrams,
to stop it. But it didn't do any good;
and then she got to calling at the Fairy's
house, but the girl that came to the
door always said, &ldquo;Not at home,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Engaged,&rdquo; or &ldquo;At dinner,&rdquo; or something
like that; and so it went on till it
came to the old once-a-year Christmas
Eve. The little girl fell asleep, and when
she woke up in the morning&mdash;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;She found it was all nothing but a
dream,&rdquo; suggested the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said her papa. &ldquo;It
was all every bit true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what <i>did</i> she find out, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that it wasn't Christmas at
last, and wasn't ever going to be, any
more. Now it's time for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl held her papa fast
around the neck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You sha'n't go if you're going to
leave it <i>so</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you want it left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christmas once a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said her papa; and he
went on again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, there was the greatest rejoicing
all over the country, and it extended
clear up into Canada. The people met
together everywhere, and kissed and
cried for joy. The city carts went
around and gathered up all the candy
and raisins and nuts, and dumped them
into the river; and it made the fish perfectly
sick; and the whole United States,
as far out as Alaska, was one blaze of
bonfires, where the children were burning
up their gift-books and presents of
all kinds. They had the greatest <i>time</i>!</p>

<p>The little girl went to thank the old
Fairy because she had stopped its being
Christmas, and she said she hoped she
would keep her promise and see that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Christmas never, never came again.
Then the Fairy frowned, and asked her
if she was sure she knew what she
meant; and the little girl asked her,
Why not? and the old Fairy said that
now she was behaving just as greedily
as ever, and she'd better look out. This
made the little girl think it all over carefully
again, and she said she would be
willing to have it Christmas about once
in a thousand years; and then she said
a hundred, and then she said ten, and
at last she got down to one. Then the
Fairy said that was the good old way
that had pleased people ever since
Christmas began, and she was agreed.
Then the little girl said, &ldquo;What're your
shoes made of?&rdquo; And the Fairy said,
&ldquo;Leather.&rdquo; And the little girl said,
&ldquo;Bargain's done forever,&rdquo; and skipped
off, and hippity-hopped the whole way
home, she was so glad.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;How will that do?&rdquo; asked the papa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;First-rate!&rdquo; said the little girl; but
she hated to have the story stop, and
was rather sober. However, her mamma
put her head in at the door, and
asked her papa:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you never coming to breakfast?
What have you been telling that child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a moral tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl caught him around the
neck again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> know! Don't you tell <i>what</i>,
papa! Don't you tell <i>what</i>!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; the papa began,
on Christmas morning, when the little
girl had snuggled in his lap into just
the right shape for listening, &ldquo;it was
the night after Thanksgiving, and you
know how everybody feels the night
after Thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but you needn't begin that
way, papa,&rdquo; said the little girl; &ldquo;I'm
not going to have any moral to it this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! But it can be a true
story, can't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said the little girl;
&ldquo;I like made-up ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is going to be a true one,
anyway, and it's no use talking.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All the relations in the neighborhood
had come to dinner, and then gone back
to their own houses, but some of the relations
had come from a distance, and
these had to stay all night at the grandfather's.
But whether they went or
whether they stayed, they all told the
grandmother that they did believe it
was the best Thanksgiving dinner they
had ever eaten in their born days. They
had had cranberry sauce, and they'd had
mashed potato, and they'd had mince-pie
and pandowdy, and they'd had celery,
and they'd had Hubbard squash,
and they'd had tea and coffee both, and
they'd had apple-dumpling with hard
sauce, and they'd had hot biscuit and
sweet pickle, and mangoes, and frosted
cake, and nuts, and cauliflower&mdash;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Don't mix them all up so!&rdquo; pleaded
the little girl. &ldquo;It's perfectly confusing.
I can't hardly tell <i>what</i> they had now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>they</i> mixed them up just in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the same way, and I suppose that's one
of the reasons why it happened.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whenever a child wanted to go back
from dumpling and frosted cake to
mashed potato and Hubbard squash&mdash;they
were old-fashioned kind of people,
and they had everything on the table at
once, because the grandmother and the
aunties cooked it, and they couldn't keep
jumping up all the time to change the
plates&mdash;and its mother said it shouldn't,
its grandmother said, Indeed it should,
then, and helped it herself; and the
child's father would say, Well, he guessed
<i>he</i> would go back, too, for a change;
and the child's mother would say, She
should think he would be ashamed;
and then they would get to going back,
till everything was perfectly higgledy-piggledy.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>shouldn't</i> you like to have been
there, papa?&rdquo; sighed the little girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn't interrupt. Where was
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higgledy-piggledy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, but the greatest thing of all
was the turkey that they had. It was
a gobbler, I tell you, that was nearly as
big as a giraffe.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It took the premium at the county
fair, and when it was dressed it weighed
fifteen pounds&mdash;well, maybe twenty&mdash;and
it was so heavy that the grandmothers
and the aunties couldn't put it
on the table, and they had to get one of
the papas to do it. You ought to have
heard the hurrahing when the children
saw him coming in from the kitchen
with it. It seemed as if they couldn't
hardly talk of anything but that turkey
the whole dinner-time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The grandfather hated to carve, and
so one of the papas did it; and whenever
he gave anybody a piece, the grandfather
would tell some new story about
the turkey, till pretty soon the aunties
got to saying, &ldquo;Now, father, stop!&rdquo;
and one of them said it made it seem
as if the gobbler was walking about on
the table, to hear so much about him,
and it took her appetite all away; and
that made the papas begin to ask the
grandfather more and more about the
turkey.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the little girl, thoughtfully;
&ldquo;I know what <i>papas</i> are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they're pretty much all alike.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And the mammas began to say they
acted like a lot of silly boys; and what
would the children think? But nothing
could stop it; and all through the
afternoon and evening, whenever the
papas saw any of the aunties or mam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>mas
round, they would begin to ask the
grandfather more particulars about the
turkey. The grandfather was pretty
forgetful, and he told the same things
right over. Well, and so it went on till
it came bedtime, and then the mammas
and aunties began to laugh and whisper
together, and to say they did believe
they should dream about that turkey;
and when the papas kissed the grandmother
good-night, they said, Well,
they must have his mate for Christmas;
and then they put their arms round
the mammas and went out haw-hawing.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think they behaved very dignified,&rdquo;
said the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, they were just funning,
and had got going, and it was
Thanksgiving, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, in about half an hour everybody
was fast asleep and dreaming&mdash;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it going to be a dream?&rdquo; asked
the little girl, with some reluctance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't I say it was going to be a
<i>true</i> story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can it be a dream, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said everybody was fast asleep
and dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but I hadn't got through. Everybody
<i>except</i> one little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you go and say her name was
the same as mine, and her eyes the same
color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>This</i> was a very <i>good</i> little girl, and
very respectful to her papa, and didn't
suspect him of tricks, but just believed
everything he said. And she was a
very pretty little girl, and had red eyes,
and blue cheeks, and straight hair, and
a curly nose&mdash;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, papa, if you get to cutting
up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won't, then!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, she was rather a delicate little
girl, and whenever she over-ate, or anything,</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Have bad dreams! Aha! I <i>told</i>
you it was going to be a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait till I get through.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She was apt to lie awake thinking, and
some of her thinks were pretty dismal.
Well, that night, instead of thinking and
tossing and turning, and counting a thousand,
it seemed to this other little girl
that she began to see things as soon
as she had got warm in bed, and before,
even. And the first thing she saw was
a large, bronze-colored&mdash;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Turkey gobbler!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma'am. Turkey gobbler's <i>ghost</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foo!&rdquo; said the little girl, rather un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>easily;
&ldquo;whoever heard of a turkey's
ghost, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, that,&rdquo; said the papa.
&ldquo;If it hadn't been a ghost, could the
moonlight have shone through it? No,
indeed! The stuffing wouldn't have
let it. So you see it must have been a
ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It had a red pasteboard placard round
its neck, with <span class="smcap">First Premium</span> printed on
it, and so she knew that it was the ghost
of the very turkey they had had for dinner.
It was perfectly awful when it put
up its tail, and dropped its wings, and
strutted just the way the grandfather
said it used to do. It seemed to be in a
wide pasture, like that back of the house,
and the children had to cross it to get
home, and they were all afraid of the
turkey that kept gobbling at them and
threatening them, because they had eaten
him up. At last one of the boys&mdash;it
was the other little girl's brother&mdash;said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
he would run across and get his papa to
come out and help them, and the first
thing she knew the turkey was after
him, gaining, gaining, gaining, and all
the grass was full of hen-turkeys and
turkey chicks, running after him, and
gaining, gaining, gaining, and just as he
was getting to the wall he tripped and
fell over a turkey-pen, and all at once
she was in one of the aunties' room, and
the aunty was in bed, and the turkeys
were walking up and down over her, and
stretching out their wings, and blaming
her. Two of them carried a platter of
chicken pie, and there was a large pumpkin
jack-o'-lantern hanging to the bedpost
to light the room, and it looked
just like the other little girl's brother
in the face, only perfectly ridiculous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;THE OLD GOBBLER &lsquo;FIRST PREMIUM&rsquo; SAID THEY WERE GOING TO TURN THE TABLES NOW.&rdquo;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Then the old gobbler, First Premium,
clapped his wings, and said, &ldquo;Come on,
chick-chickledren!&rdquo; and then they all
seemed to be in her room, and she was
standing in the middle of it in her nigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>t-gown,
and tied round and round with
ribbons, so she couldn't move hand or
foot. The old gobbler, First Premium,
said they were going to turn the tables
now, and she knew what he meant, for
they had had that in the reader at school
just before vacation, and the teacher had
explained it. He made a long speech,
with his hat on, and kept pointing at her
with one of his wings, while he told the
other turkeys that it was her grandfather
who had done it, and now it was
their turn. He said that human beings
had been eating turkeys ever since the
discovery of America, and it was time
for the turkeys to begin paying them
back, if they were ever going to. He
said she was pretty young, but she was
as big as he was, and he had no doubt
they would enjoy her.</p>

<p>The other little girl tried to tell him
that she was not to blame, and that she
only took a very, very little piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was right off the breast,&rdquo; said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the gobbler, and he shed tears, so that
the other little girl cried, too. She
didn't have much hopes, they all seemed
so spiteful, especially the little turkey
chicks; but she told them that she
was very tender-hearted, and never hurt
a single thing, and she tried to make
them understand that there was a great
difference between eating people and
just eating turkeys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference, I should like to
know?&rdquo; says the old hen-turkey, pretty
snappishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People have got souls, and turkeys
haven't,&rdquo; says the other little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how <i>that</i> makes it any
better,&rdquo; says the old hen-turkey. &ldquo;It
don't make it any better for the <i>turkeys</i>.
If we haven't got any souls, we
can't live after we've been eaten up,
and you <i>can</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other little girl was awfully
frightened to have the hen-turkey take
that tack.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think she would 'a' been,&rdquo;
said the little girl; and she cuddled
snugger into her papa's arms. &ldquo;What
<i>could</i> she say? Ugh! Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, she didn't know what to say,
that's a fact. You see, she never thought
of it in that light before. All she could
say was, &ldquo;Well, people have got reason,
anyway, and turkeys have only got instinct;
so there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better look out,&rdquo; says the old
hen-turkey; and all the little turkey
chicks got so mad they just hopped, and
the oldest little he-turkey, that was just
beginning to be a gobbler, he dropped
his wings and spread his tail just like
his father, and walked round the other
little girl till it was perfectly frightful.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I should think they would 'a' been
ashamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>Well, perhaps old First Premium <i>was</i>
a little; because he stopped them. &ldquo;My
dear,&rdquo; he says to the old hen-turkey,
and chick-chickledren, &ldquo;you forget yourselves;
you should have a little consideration.
Perhaps you wouldn't behave
much better yourselves if you were just
going to be eaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they all began to scream and to
cry, &ldquo;We've <i>been</i> eaten, and we're nothing
but turkey ghosts.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;<i>There</i>, now, papa,&rdquo; says the little
girl, sitting up straight, so as to argue
better, &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> it wasn't true, all along.
How could turkeys have ghosts if they
don't have souls, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, easily,&rdquo; said the papa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell how,&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; said the papa, &ldquo;are
you telling this story, or am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said the little girl, and
she cuddled down again. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, don't you interrupt.
Where was I? Oh yes.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, he couldn't do anything with
them, old First Premium couldn't. They
acted perfectly ridiculous, and one little
brat of a spiteful little chick piped out,
&ldquo;I speak for a drumstick, ma!&rdquo; and then
they all began: &ldquo;I want a wing, ma!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I'm going to have the wish-bone!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I shall have just as much stuffing
as ever I please, shan't I, ma?&rdquo; till the
other little girl was perfectly disgusted
with them; she thought they oughtn't
to say it before her, anyway; but she
had hardly thought this before they all
screamed out, &ldquo;They used to say it before
<i>us</i>,&rdquo; and then she didn't know what
to say, because she knew how people
talked before animals.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe I ever did,&rdquo; said the
little girl. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, old First Premium tried to quiet
them again, and when he couldn't he
apologized to the other little girl so
nicely that she began to like him. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
said they didn't mean any harm by it;
they were just excited, and chickledren
would be chickledren.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other little girl, &ldquo;but
I think you might take some older person
to begin with. It's a perfect shame
to begin with a little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin!&rdquo; says old First Premium.
&ldquo;Do you think we're just <i>beginning</i>?
Why, when do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The night after Thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;1886.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all gave a perfect screech.
&ldquo;Why, it's Christmas Eve, 1900, and
every one of your friends has been eaten
up long ago,&rdquo; says old First Premium,
and he began to cry over her, and the
old hen-turkey and the little turkey
chicks began to wipe their eyes on the
backs of their wings.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think they were very neat,&rdquo;
said the little girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Well, they were kind-hearted, anyway,
and they felt sorry for the other
little girl. And she began to think she
had made some little impression on
them, when she noticed the old hen-turkey
beginning to untie her bonnet
strings, and the turkey chicks began to
spread round her in a circle, with the
points of their wings touching, so that
she couldn't get out, and they commenced
dancing and singing, and after a
while that little he-turkey says, &ldquo;Who's
<i>it</i>?&rdquo; and the other little girl, she didn't
know why, says, &ldquo;<i>I'm</i> it,&rdquo; and old First
Premium says, &ldquo;Do you promise?&rdquo; and
the other little girl says, &ldquo;Yes, I promise,&rdquo;
and she knew she was promising,
if they would let her go, that people
should never eat turkeys any more.
And the moon began to shine brighter
and brighter through the turkeys, and
pretty soon it was the sun, and then it
was not the turkeys, but the window-curtains&mdash;it
was one of those old farm-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>houses
where they don't have blinds&mdash;and
the other little girl&mdash;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Woke up!&rdquo; shouted the little girl.
&ldquo;There now, papa, what did I tell you?
I <i>knew</i> it was a dream all along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she didn't,&rdquo; said the papa; &ldquo;and
it wasn't a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a&mdash;trance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl turned round, and knelt
in her papa's lap, so as to take him by
the shoulders and give him a good shaking.
That made him promise to be good,
pretty quick, and, &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo;
says the little girl; &ldquo;if it wasn't a dream,
you've got to prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can I prove it?&rdquo; says the
papa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By going on with the story,&rdquo; says the
little girl, and she cuddled down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that's easy enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>As soon as it was light in the room,
the other little girl could see that the
place was full of people, crammed and
jammed, and they were all awfully excited,
and kept yelling, &ldquo;Down with the
traitress!&rdquo; &ldquo;Away with the renegade!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shame on the little sneak!&rdquo; till it was
worse than the turkeys, ten times.</p>

<p>She knew that they meant her, and
she tried to explain that she just <i>had</i> to
promise, and that if they had been in her
place they would have promised too; and
of course they could do as they pleased
about keeping her word, but she was
going to keep it, anyway, and never,
never, never eat another piece of turkey
either at Thanksgiving or at Christmas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; says an old lady,
who looked like her grandmother, and
then began to have a crown on, and to
turn into Queen Victoria, &ldquo;what <i>can</i>
we have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the other little girl,
&ldquo;you can have oyster soup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can have cranberry sauce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have mashed potatoes, and
Hubbard squash, and celery, and turnip,
and cauliflower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have mince-pie, and pandowdy,
and plum-pudding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not a thing on the list,&rdquo; says
the Queen, &ldquo;that doesn't go with turkey!
Now you see.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The papa stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn't any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl turned round, got up
on her knees, took him by the shoulders,
and shook him fearfully. &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo;
she said, while the papa let his head
wag, after the shaking, like a Chinese
mandarin's, and it was a good thing he
did not let his tongue stick out. &ldquo;Now,
will you go on? What <i>did</i> the people
eat in place of turkey?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know, you awful papa!
Well, then, what did the little girl eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She?&rdquo; The papa freed himself, and
made his preparation to escape. &ldquo;Why
she&mdash;oh, <i>she</i> ate goose. Goose is tenderer
than turkey, anyway, and more
digestible; and there isn't so much of
it, and you can't overeat yourself, and
have bad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreams!&rdquo; cried the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trances,&rdquo; said the papa, and she began
to chase him all round the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PONY ENGINE AND THE
PACIFIC EXPRESS.</h2>


<p>Christmas Eve, after the children had
hung up their stockings and got all
ready for St. Nic, they climbed up on
the papa's lap to kiss him good-night,
and when they both got their arms
round his neck, they said they were not
going to bed till he told them a Christmas
story. Then he saw that he would
have to mind, for they were awfully severe
with him, and always made him do
exactly what they told him; it was the
way they had brought him up. He
tried his best to get out of it for a
while; but after they had shaken him
first this side, and then that side, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
pulled him backward and forward till
he did not know where he was, he began
to think perhaps he had better begin.
The first thing he said, after he
opened his eyes, and made believe he
had been asleep, or something, was,
&ldquo;Well, what did I leave off at?&rdquo; and
that made them just perfectly boiling,
for they understood his tricks, and they
knew he was trying to pretend that he
had told part of the story already; and
they said he had not left off anywhere
because he had not commenced, and he
saw it was no use. So he commenced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once there was a little Pony Engine
that used to play round the Fitchburg
Depot on the side tracks, and
sleep in among the big locomotives in
the car-house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl lifted her head from the
papa's shoulder, where she had dropped
it. &ldquo;Is it a sad story, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it going to end?&rdquo; asked the
boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it's got a moral,&rdquo; said the papa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, if it's got a moral,&rdquo; said
the children; they had a good deal of
fun with the morals the papa put to his
stories. The boy added, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; and
the little girl prompted, &ldquo;Car-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The papa said, &ldquo;Now every time you
stop me I shall have to begin all over
again.&rdquo; But he saw that this was not
going to spite them any, so he went on:
&ldquo;One of the locomotives was its mother,
and she had got hurt once in a big
smash-up, so that she couldn't run long
trips any more. She was so weak in
the chest you could hear her wheeze as
far as you could see her. But she could
work round the depot, and pull empty
cars in and out, and shunt them off on
the side tracks; and she was so anxious
to be useful that all the other engines
respected her, and they were very kind
to the little Pony Engine on her account,
though it was always getting in
the way, and under their wheels, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
everything. They all knew it was an
orphan, for before its mother got hurt
its father went through a bridge one
dark night into an arm of the sea, and
was never heard of again; he was supposed
to have been drowned. The old
mother locomotive used to say that it
would never have happened if she had
been there; but poor dear No. 236 was
always so venturesome, and she had
warned him against that very bridge
time and again. Then she would whistle
so dolefully, and sigh with her air-brakes
enough to make anybody cry. You see
they used to be a very happy family
when they were all together, before the
papa locomotive got drowned. He was
very fond of the little Pony Engine, and
told it stories at night after they got
into the car-house, at the end of some
of his long runs. It would get up on
his cow-catcher, and lean its chimney up
against his, and listen till it fell asleep.
Then he would put it softly down, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be off again in the morning before it
was awake. I tell you, those were happy
days for poor No. 236. The little
Pony Engine could just remember him;
it was awfully proud of its papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy lifted his head and looked at
the little girl, who suddenly hid her face
in the papa's other shoulder. &ldquo;Well, I
declare, papa, she was putting up her
lip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn't, any such thing!&rdquo; said the
little girl. &ldquo;And I don't care! So!&rdquo; and
then she sobbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, never you mind,&rdquo; said the papa
to the boy. &ldquo;You'll be putting up <i>your</i>
lip before I'm through. Well, and then
she used to caution the little Pony Engine
against getting in the way of the
big locomotives, and told it to keep close
round after her, and try to do all it
could to learn about shifting empty
cars. You see, she knew how ambitious
the little Pony Engine was, and how it
wasn't contented a bit just to grow up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
in the pony-engine business, and be tied
down to the depot all its days. Once
she happened to tell it that if it was
good and always did what it was bid,
perhaps a cow-catcher would grow on it
some day, and then it could be a passenger
locomotive. Mammas have to
promise all sorts of things, and she was
almost distracted when she said that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think she ought to have deceived
it, papa,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;But it
ought to have known that if it was a
Pony Engine to begin with, it never
could have a cow-catcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn't it?&rdquo; asked the little girl,
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they're kind of mooley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl asked the papa, &ldquo;What
makes Pony Engines mooley?&rdquo; for she
did not choose to be told by her brother;
he was only two years older than
she was, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; it's pretty hard to say. You see,
when a locomotive is first hatched&mdash;&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are they hatched, papa?&rdquo; asked
the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we'll <i>call</i> it hatched,&rdquo; said the
papa; but they knew he was just funning.
&ldquo;They're about the size of tea-kettles
at first; and it's a chance
whether they will have cow-catchers
or not. If they keep their spouts, they
will; and if their spouts drop off, they
won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes the spout ever drop
off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sometimes the pip, or the
gapes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children both began to shake the
papa, and he was glad enough to go on
sensibly. &ldquo;Well, anyway, the mother
locomotive certainly oughtn't to have
deceived it. Still she had to say <i>something</i>,
and perhaps the little Pony Engine
was better employed watching its
buffers with its head-light, to see whether
its cow-catcher had begun to grow,
than it would have been in listening to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the stories of the old locomotives, and
sometimes their swearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they swear, papa?&rdquo; asked the
little girl, somewhat shocked, and yet
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never heard them, <i>near by</i>.
But it sounds a good deal like swearing
when you hear them on the up-grade
on our hill in the night. Where was I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swearing,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;And
please don't go back, now, papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won't. It'll be as much as
I can do to get through this story, without
going over any of it again. Well,
the thing that the little Pony Engine
wanted to be, the most in this world,
was the locomotive of the Pacific Express,
that starts out every afternoon at
three, you know. It intended to apply
for the place as soon as its cow-catcher
was grown, and it was always trying to
attract the locomotive's attention, backing
and filling on the track alongside of
the train; and once it raced it a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
piece, and beat it, before the Express locomotive
was under way, and almost got
in front of it on a switch. My, but its
mother was scared! She just yelled to
it with her whistle; and that night she
sent it to sleep without a particle of coal
or water in its tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the little Pony Engine didn't
care. It had beaten the Pacific Express
in a hundred yards, and what was
to hinder it from beating it as long as
it chose? The little Pony Engine could
not get it out of its head. It was just
like a boy who thinks he can whip a
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy lifted his head. &ldquo;Well, a
boy <i>can</i>, papa, if he goes to do it the
right way. Just stoop down before the
man knows it, and catch him by the
legs and tip him right over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! I guess you see yourself!&rdquo; said
the little girl, scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>could</i>!&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;and
some day I'll just show you.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, little cock-sparrow, now!&rdquo; said
the papa; and he laughed. &ldquo;Well, the
little Pony Engine thought he could beat
the Pacific Express, anyway; and so one
dark, snowy, blowy afternoon, when his
mother was off pushing some empty coal
cars up past the Know-Nothing crossing
beyond Charlestown, he got on the track
in front of the Express, and when he
heard the conductor say &lsquo;All aboard,&rsquo;
and the starting gong struck, and the
brakemen leaned out and waved to the
engineer, he darted off like lightning.
He had his steam up, and he just scuttled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was so excited for a while
that he couldn't tell whether the Express
was gaining on him or not; but
after twenty or thirty miles, he thought
he heard it pretty near. Of course the
Express locomotive was drawing a heavy
train of cars, and it had to make a stop
or two&mdash;at Charlestown, and at Concord
Junction, and at Ayer&mdash;so the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Pony Engine did really gain on it a
little; and when it began to be scared
it gained a good deal. But the first
place where it began to feel sorry, and
to want its mother, was in Hoosac Tunnel.
It never was in a tunnel before,
and it seemed as if it would never get
out. It kept thinking, What if the Pacific
Express was to run over it there in
the dark, and its mother off there at the
Fitchburg Depot, in Boston, looking for
it among the side-tracks? It gave a perfect
shriek; and just then it shot out of
the tunnel. There were a lot of locomotives
loafing around there at North
Adams, and one of them shouted out
to it as it flew by, &lsquo;What's your hurry,
little one?&rsquo; and it just screamed back,
&lsquo;Pacific Express!&rsquo; and never stopped to
explain. They talked in locomotive language&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what did it sound like?&rdquo; the boy
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, pretty queer; I'll tell you some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
day. It knew it had no time to fool
away, and all through the long, dark
night, whenever, a locomotive hailed it,
it just screamed, &lsquo;Pacific Express!&rsquo; and
kept on. And the Express kept gaining
on it. Some of the locomotives
wanted to stop it, but they decided they
had better not get in its way, and so it
whizzed along across New York State
and Ohio and Indiana, till it got to
Chicago. And the Express kept gaining
on it. By that time it was so hoarse
it could hardly whisper, but it kept saying,
&lsquo;Pacific Express! Pacific Express!&rsquo;
and it kept right on till it reached the
Mississippi River. There it found a
long train of freight cars before it on
the bridge. It couldn't wait, and so it
slipped down from the track to the
edge of the river and jumped across,
and then scrambled up the embankment
to the track again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; said the little girl, warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly it did,&rdquo; said the papa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! that's nothing,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;A whole train of cars did it in that
Jules Verne book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the papa went on, &ldquo;after that
it had a little rest, for the Express had
to wait for the freight train to get off
the bridge, and the Pony Engine stopped
at the first station for a drink of water
and a mouthful of coal, and then it flew
ahead. There was a kind old locomotive
at Omaha that tried to find out
where it belonged, and what its mother's
name was, but the Pony Engine was so
bewildered it couldn't tell. And the
Express kept gaining on it. On the
plains it was chased by a pack of prairie
wolves, but it left them far behind; and
the antelopes were scared half to death.
But the worst of it was when the nightmare
got after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nightmare? Goodness!&rdquo; said
the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've had the nightmare,&rdquo; said the
little girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, a mere human nightmare,&rdquo;
said the papa. &ldquo;But a locomotive
nightmare is a very different thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what's it like?&rdquo; asked the boy.
The little girl was almost afraid to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it has only one leg, to begin
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wheel, I mean. And it has four
cow-catchers, and four head-lights, and
two boilers, and eight whistles, and it
just goes whirling and screeching along.
Of course it wobbles awfully; and as
it's only got one wheel, it has to keep
skipping from one track to the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it would run on the
cross-ties,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, then!&rdquo; said the papa.
&ldquo;If you know so much more about it
than I do! Who's telling this story,
anyway? Now I shall have to go back
to the beginning. Once there was a
little Pony En&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They both put their hands over his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mouth, and just fairly begged him to
go on, and at last he did. &ldquo;Well, it got
away from the nightmare about morning,
but not till the nightmare had bitten
a large piece out of its tender, and
then it braced up for the home-stretch.
It thought that if it could once beat the
Express to the Sierras, it could keep the
start the rest of the way, for it could
get over the mountains quicker than the
Express could, and it might be in San
Francisco before the Express got to
Sacramento. The Express kept gaining
on it. But it just zipped along the
upper edge of Kansas and the lower
edge of Nebraska, and on through Colorado
and Utah and Nevada, and when
it got to the Sierras it just stooped a
little, and went over them like a goat;
it did, truly; just doubled up its fore
wheels under it, and jumped. And the
Express kept gaining on it. By this
time it couldn't say &lsquo;Pacific Express&rsquo;
any more, and it didn't try. It just said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
&lsquo;Express! Express!&rsquo; and then &lsquo;'Press!
'Press!&rsquo; and then &lsquo;'Ess! 'Ess!&rsquo; and pretty
soon only &lsquo;'Ss! 'Ss!&rsquo; And the Express
kept gaining on it. Before they
reached San Francisco, the Express
locomotive's cow-catcher was almost
touching the Pony Engine's tender;
it gave one howl of anguish as it felt
the Express locomotive's hot breath on
the place where the nightmare had bitten
the piece out, and tore through the
end of the San Francisco depot, and
plunged into the Pacific Ocean, and was
never seen again. There, now,&rdquo; said the
papa, trying to make the children get
down, &ldquo;that's all. Go to bed.&rdquo; The
little girl was crying, and so he tried to
comfort her by keeping her in his lap.</p>

<p>The boy cleared his throat. &ldquo;What
is the moral, papa?&rdquo; he asked, huskily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children, obey your parents,&rdquo; said
the papa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what became of the mother locomotive?&rdquo;
pursued the boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She had a brain-fever, and never
quite recovered the use of her mind
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy thought awhile. &ldquo;Well, I
don't see what it had to do with Christmas,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it was Christmas Eve when
the Pony Engine started from Boston,
and Christmas afternoon when it reached
San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;No locomotive
could get across the continent in a day
and a night, let alone a little Pony Engine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this Pony Engine <i>had</i> to. Did
you never hear of the beaver that clomb
the tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, some other time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how <i>could</i> it get across so quick?
Just one day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it was a year. Maybe
it was the <i>next</i> Christmas after that
when it got to San Francisco.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The papa set the little girl down, and
started to run out of the room, and both
of the children ran after him, to pound
him.</p>

<p>When they were in bed the boy called
down-stairs to the papa, &ldquo;Well, anyway,
I didn't put up my lip.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The papa had told the story so often
that the children knew just exactly
what to expect the moment he began.
They all knew it as well as he knew it
himself, and they could keep him from
making mistakes, or forgetting. Sometimes
he would go wrong on purpose, or
would pretend to forget, and then they
had a perfect right to pound him till he
quit it. He usually quit pretty soon.</p>

<p>The children liked it because it was
very exciting, and at the same time it
had no moral, so that when it was all
over, they could feel that they had not
been excited just for the moral. The
first time the little girl heard it she be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>gan
to cry, when it came to the worst
part; but the boy had heard it so much
by that time that he did not mind it in
the least, and just laughed.</p>

<p>The story was in season any time between
Thanksgiving and New Years;
but the papa usually began to tell it
in the early part of October, when the
farmers were getting in their pumpkins,
and the children were asking when they
were going to have any squash pies, and
the boy had made his first jack-o'-lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the papa said, &ldquo;once there
were two little pumpkin seeds, and one
was a good little pumpkin seed, and the
other was bad&mdash;very proud, and vain,
and ambitious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The papa had told them what ambitious
was, and so the children did not
stop him when he came to that word;
but sometimes he would stop of his own
accord, and then if they could not tell
what it meant, he would pretend that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he was not going on; but he always did
go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the farmer took both the seeds
out to plant them in the home-patch,
because they were a very extra kind of
seeds, and he was not going to risk them
in the cornfield, among the corn. So
before he put them in the ground, he
asked each one of them what he wanted
to be when he came up, and the good little
pumpkin seed said he wanted to come
up a pumpkin, and be made into a pie,
and be eaten at Thanksgiving dinner;
and the bad little pumpkin seed said he
wanted to come up a morning-glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Morning-glory!&rsquo; says the farmer.
&lsquo;I guess you'll come up a pumpkin-glory,
first thing <i>you</i> know,&rsquo; and then he haw-hawed,
and told his son, who was helping
him to plant the garden, to keep
watch of that particular hill of pumpkins,
and see whether that little seed
came up a morning-glory or not; and
the boy stuck a stick into the hill so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
he could tell it. But one night the
cow got in, and the farmer was so mad,
having to get up about one o'clock in
the morning to drive the cow out, that
he pulled up the stick, without noticing,
to whack her over the back with it, and
so they lost the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the two little pumpkin seeds,
they knew where they were well enough,
and they lay low, and let the rain and
the sun soak in and swell them up; and
then they both began to push, and by-and-by
they got their heads out of the
ground, with their shells down over
their eyes like caps, and as soon as they
could shake them off and look round,
the bad little pumpkin vine said to his
brother:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what are you going to do
now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good little pumpkin vine said,
&lsquo;Oh, I'm just going to stay here, and
grow and grow, and put out all the blossoms
I can, and let them all drop off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
but one, and then grow that into the
biggest and fattest and sweetest pumpkin
that ever was for Thanksgiving
pies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, that's what I am going to
do, too,&rsquo; said the bad little pumpkin
vine, &lsquo;all but the pies; but I'm not going
to stay here to do it. I'm going to
that fence over there, where the morning-glories
were last summer, and I'm
going to show them what a pumpkin-glory
is like. I'm just going to cover
myself with blossoms; and blossoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that won't shut up, either, when the
sun comes out, but 'll stay open, as if
they hadn't anything to be ashamed of,
and that won't drop off the first day,
either. I noticed those morning-glories
all last summer, when I was nothing
but one of the blossoms myself, and I
just made up my mind that as soon as
ever I got to be a vine, I would show
them a thing or two. Maybe I <i>can't</i> be
a morning-glory, but I can be a pumpkin-glory,
and I guess that's glory
enough.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It made the cold chills run over the
good little vine to hear its brother talk
like that, and it begged him not to do
it; and it began to cry&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; The papa stopped
short, and the boy stopped whispering
in his sister's ear, and she answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said he bet it was a girl!&rdquo; The
tears stood in her eyes, and the boy
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, it was <i>like</i> a girl.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir!&rdquo; said the papa.
&ldquo;And supposing it was? Which is better:
to stay quietly at home, and do your
duty, and grow up, and be eaten in a
pie at Thanksgiving, or go gadding all
over the garden, and climbing fences,
and everything? The good little pumpkin
vine was perfectly right, and the
bad little pumpkin would have been
saved a good deal if it had minded its
little sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The farmer was pretty busy that
summer, and after the first two or three
hoeings he had to leave the two pumpkin
vines to the boy that had helped
him to plant the seed, and the boy had
to go fishing so much, and then in
swimming, that he perfectly neglected
them, and let them run wild, if they
wanted to; and if the good little pumpkin
vine had not been the best little
pumpkin vine that ever was, it <i>would</i>
have run wild. But it just stayed where
it was, and thickened up, and covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
itself with blossoms, till it was like one
mass of gold. It was very fond of all
its blossoms, and it couldn't bear hardly
to think of losing any of them; but it
knew they couldn't every one grow up
to be a very large pumpkin, and so it
let them gradually drop off till it only
had one left, and then it just gave all
its attention to that one, and did everything
it could to make it grow into the
kind of pumpkin it said it would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this time the bad little pumpkin
vine was carrying out its plan of being
a pumpkin-glory. In the first place it
found out that if it expected to get
through by fall it couldn't fool much
putting out a lot of blossoms and waiting
for them to drop off, before it began
to devote itself to business. The fence
was a good piece off, and it had to reach
the fence in the first place, for there
wouldn't be any fun in being a pumpkin-glory
down where nobody could see you,
or anything. So the bad little pumpkin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
vine began to pull and stretch towards
the fence, and sometimes it thought it
would surely snap in two, it pulled and
stretched so hard. But besides the
pulling and stretching, it had to hide,
and go round, because if it had been
seen it wouldn't have been allowed to
go to the fence. It was a good thing
there were so many weeds, that the boy
was too lazy to pull up, and the bad little
pumpkin vine could hide among. But
then they were a good deal of a hinderance,
too, because they were so thick it
could hardly get through them. It had
to pass some rows of pease that were
perfectly awful; they tied themselves
to it and tried to keep it back; and
there was one hill of cucumbers that
acted ridiculously; they said it was a
cucumber vine running away from home,
and they would have kept it from going
any farther, if it hadn't tugged with
all its might and main, and got away
one night when the cucumbers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
sleeping; it was pretty strong, anyway.
When it got to the fence at last, it
thought it was going to die. It was all
pulled out so thin that it wasn't any
thicker than a piece of twine in some
places, and its leaves just hung in tatters.
It hadn't had time to put out more
than one blossom, and that was such a
poor little sickly thing that it could hardly
hang on. The question was, How can
a pumpkin vine climb a fence, anyway?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its knees and elbows were all worn
to strings getting there, or that's what
the pumpkin thought, till it wound one
of those tendrils round a splinter of the
fence, without thinking, and happened
to pull, and then it was perfectly surprised
to find that it seemed to lift itself
off the ground a little. It said to itself,
&lsquo;Let's try a few more,&rsquo; and it twisted
some more of the tendrils round some
more splinters, and this time it fairly
lifted itself off the ground. It said,
&lsquo;Ah, I see!&rsquo; as if it had somehow ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>pected
to do something of the kind all
along; but it had to be pretty careful
getting up the fence not to knock its
blossom off, for that would have been
the end of it; and when it did get up
among the morning-glories it almost
killed the poor thing, keeping it open
night and day, and showing it off in the
hottest sun, and not giving it a bit of
shade, but just holding it out where it
could be seen the whole time. It wasn't
very much of a blossom compared with
the blossoms on the good little pumpkin
vine, but it was bigger than any of the
morning-glories, and that was some
satisfaction, and the bad little pumpkin
vine was as proud as if it was the largest
blossom in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the blossom's leaves dropped
off, and a little pumpkin began to grow
on in its place, the vine did everything
it could for it; just gave itself up to it,
and put all its strength into it. After
all, it was a pretty queer-looking pump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>kin,
though. It had to grow hanging
down, and not resting on anything, and
after it started with a round head, like
other pumpkins, its neck began to pull
out, and pull out, till it looked like a
gourd or a big pear. That's the way it
looked in the fall, hanging from the vine
on the fence, when the first light frost
came and killed the vine. It was the
day when the farmer was gathering his
pumpkins in the cornfield, and he just
happened to remember the seeds he had
planted in the home-patch, and he got
out of his wagon to see what had become
of them. He was perfectly astonished
to see the size of the good little
pumpkin; you could hardly get it into a
bushel basket, and he gathered it, and
sent it to the county fair, and took the
first premium with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much was the premium?&rdquo; asked
the boy. He yawned; he had heard all
these facts so often before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="illus_3" id="illus_3"></a>

<span class="caption">TOOK THE FIRST PREMIUM AT THE COUNTY FAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It was fifty cents; but you see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
farmer had to pay two dollars to get a
chance to try for the premium at the
fair; and so it was <i>some</i> satisfaction.
Anyway, he took the premium, and he
tried to sell the pumpkin, and when he
couldn't, he brought it home and told
his wife they must have it for Thanksgiving.
The boy had gathered the bad
little pumpkin, and kept it from being
fed to the cow, it was so funny-looking;
and the day before Thanksgiving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the farmer found it in the barn, and
he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hollo! Here's that little fool pumpkin.
Wonder if it thinks it's a morning-glory
yet?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the boy said, &lsquo;Oh, father,
mayn't I have it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the father said, &lsquo;Guess so.
What are you going to do with it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the boy didn't tell, because he
was going to keep it for a surprise; but
as soon as his father went out of the
barn, he picked up the bad little pumpkin
by its long neck, and he kind of
balanced it before him, and he said,
&lsquo;Well, now, I'm going to make a pumpkin-glory
out of <i>you</i>!&rsquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 750px;"><a name="illus_4" id="illus_4"></a>
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="750" height="554" alt="&quot;&#39;HERE&#39;S THAT LITTLE FOOL PUMPKIN,&#39; SAID THE FARMER.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;HERE&#39;S THAT LITTLE FOOL PUMPKIN,&rsquo; SAID THE FARMER.&rdquo;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;And when the bad little pumpkin
heard that, all its seeds fairly rattled in
it for joy. The boy took out his knife,
and the first thing the pumpkin knew
he was cutting a kind of lid off the top
of it; it was like getting scalped, but
the pumpkin didn't mind it, because it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
was just the same as war. And when
the boy got the top off he poured the
seeds out, and began to scrape the inside
as thin as he could without breaking
through. It hurt awfully, and nothing
but the hope of being a pumpkin-glory
could have kept the little pumpkin
quiet; but it didn't say a word, even
after the boy had made a mouth for it,
with two rows of splendid teeth, and it
didn't cry with either of the eyes he
made for it; just winked at him with
one of them, and twisted its mouth to
one side, so as to let him know it was
in the joke; and the first thing it did
when it got one was to turn up its nose
at the good little pumpkin, which the
boy's mother came into the barn to get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show how it looked,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>And the papa twisted his mouth, and
winked with one eye, and wrinkled his
nose till the little girl begged him to
stop. Then he went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy hid the bad pumpkin be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>hind
him till his mother was gone, because
he didn't want her in the secret;
and then he slipped into the house, and
put it under his bed. It was pretty
lonesome up there in the boy's room&mdash;he
slept in the garret, and there was
nothing but broken furniture besides his
bed; but all day long it could smell the
good little pumpkin, boiling and boiling
for pies; and late at night, after the boy
had gone to sleep, it could smell the hot
pies when they came out of the oven.
They smelt splendid, but the bad little
pumpkin didn't envy them a bit; it just
said, &lsquo;Pooh! What's twenty pumpkin
pies to one pumpkin-glory?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to have said &lsquo;what <i>are</i>,&rsquo;
oughtn't it, papa?&rdquo; asked the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly ought,&rdquo; said the papa.
&ldquo;But if nothing but it's grammar had
been bad, there wouldn't have been
much to complain of about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't suppose it had ever heard
much good grammar from the farmer's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
family,&rdquo; suggested the boy. &ldquo;Farmers
always say cowcumbers instead of cucumbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> tell us about the Cowcumber,
and the Bullcumber, and the little Calfcumbers,
papa!&rdquo; the little girl entreated,
and she clasped her hands, to show how
anxious she was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! And leave off at the most
exciting part of the pumpkin-glory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl saw what a mistake she
had made; the boy just gave her <i>one
look</i>, and she cowered down into the
papa's lap, and the papa went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they had an extra big Thanksgiving
at the farmer's that day. Lots
of the relations came from out West;
the grandmother, who was living with
the farmer, was getting pretty old, and
every year or two she thought she wasn't
going to live very much longer, and she
wrote to the relations in Wisconsin, and
everywhere, that if they expected to see
her alive again, they had better come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
this time, and bring all their families.
She kept doing it till she was about
ninety, and then she just concluded to
live along and not mind how old she
was. But this was just before her
eighty-ninth birthday, and she had
drummed up so many sons and sons-in-law,
and daughters and daughters-in-law,
and grandsons and great-grandsons,
and granddaughters and great-granddaughters,
that the house was perfectly
packed with them. They had to sleep
on the floor, a good many of them, and
you could hardly step for them; the
boys slept in the barn, and they laughed
and cut up so the whole night that the
roosters thought it was morning, and
kept crowing till they made their throats
sore, and had to wear wet compresses
round them every night for a week
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the papa said anything like
this the children had a right to pound
him, but they were so anxious not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
have him stop, that this time they did
not do it. They said, &ldquo;Go on, go on!&rdquo;
and the little girl said, &ldquo;And then the
tables!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tables? Well, I should think so!
They got all the tables there were in
the house, up stairs and down, for dinner
Thanksgiving Day, and they took
the grandmother's work-stand and put
it at the head, and she sat down there;
only she was so used to knitting by that
table that she kept looking for her
knitting-needles all through dinner, and
couldn't seem to remember what it was
she was missing. The other end of the
table was the carpenter's bench that
they brought in out of the barn, and
they put the youngest and funniest papa
at that. The tables stretched from the
kitchen into the dining-room, and clear
through that out into the hall, and
across into the parlor. They hadn't
table-cloths enough to go the whole
length, and the end of the carpenter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
bench, where the funniest papa sat, was
bare, and all through dinner-time he
kept making fun. The vise was right
at the corner, and when he got his help
of turkey, he pretended that it was so
tough he had to fasten the bone in the
vise, and cut the meat off with his knife
like a draw-shave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the drumstick, I suppose,
papa?&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;A turkey's drumstick
is all full of little wooden splinters,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did the mamma say?&rdquo;
asked the little girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;"><a name="illus_5" id="illus_5"></a>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;CAUGHT HIS TROUSERS ON A SHINGLE-NAIL, AND STUCK.&rdquo;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she kept saying, &lsquo;Now you behave!&rsquo;
and, &lsquo;Well, I should think you'd
be ashamed!&rsquo; but the funniest papa didn't
mind her a bit; and everybody laughed
till they could hardly stand it. All this
time the boys were out in the barn,
waiting for the second table, and playing
round. The farmer's boy went up
to his room over the wood-shed, and got
in at the garret window, and brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
out the pumpkin-glory. Only he began
to slip when he was coming down the
roof, and he'd have slipped clear off if
he hadn't caught his trousers on a shingle-nail,
and stuck. It made a pretty
bad tear, but the other boys pinned it
up so that it wouldn't show, and the
pumpkin-glory wasn't hurt a bit. They
all said that it was about the best jack-o'-lantern
they almost ever saw, on account
of the long neck there was to it;
and they made a plan to stick the end
of the neck into the top of the pump,
and have fun hearing what the folks
would say when they came out after
dark and saw it all lit up; and then
they noticed the pigpen at the corner
of the barn, and began to plague the
pig, and so many of them got up on the
pen that they broke the middle board
off; and they didn't like to nail it on
again because it was Thanksgiving Day,
and you mustn't hammer or anything;
so they just stuck it up in its place with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a piece of wood against it, and the boy
said he would fix it in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grown folks stayed so long at
the table that it was nearly dark when
the boys got to it, and they would have
been almost starved if the farm-boy
hadn't brought out apples and doughnuts
every little while. As it was, they
were pretty hungry, and they began on
the pumpkin pie at once, so as to keep
eating till the mother and the other
mothers that were helping could get
some of the things out of the oven that
they had been keeping hot for the boys.
The pie was so nice that they kept eating
at it all along, and the mother told
them about the good little pumpkin that
it was made of, and how the good little
pumpkin had never had any wish from
the time it was nothing but a seed, except
to grow up and be made into pies
and eaten at Thanksgiving; and they
must all try to be good, too, and grow
up and do likewise. The boys didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
say anything, because their mouths were
so full, but they looked at each other
and winked their left eyes. There were
about forty or fifty of them, and when
they all winked their left eyes it made
it so dark you could hardly see; and
the mother got the lamp; but the other
mothers saw what the boys were doing,
and they just shook them till they
opened their eyes and stopped their mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show how they looked!&rdquo; said the
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't show how fifty boys looked,&rdquo;
said the papa. &ldquo;But they looked a
good deal like the pumpkin-glory that
was waiting quietly in the barn for
them to get through, and come out and
have some fun with it. When they
had all eaten so much that they could
hardly stand up, they got down from
the table, and grabbed their hats, and
started for the door. But they had to
go out the back way, because the table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
took up the front entry, and that gave
the farmer's boy a chance to find a
piece of candle out in the kitchen and
some matches; and then they rushed
to the barn. It was so dark there already
that they thought they had better
light up the pumpkin-glory and try
it. They lit it up, and it worked splendidly;
but they forgot to put out the
match, and it caught some straw on the
barn floor, and a little more and it would
have burnt the barn down. The boys
stamped the fire out in about half a
second; and after that they waited till
it was dark outside before they lit up
the pumpkin-glory again. Then they
all bent down over it to keep the wind
from blowing the match anywhere, and
pretty soon it was lit up, and the farmer's
boy took the pumpkin-glory by its
long neck, and stuck the point in the
hole in the top of the pump; and just
then the funniest papa came round the
corner of the wood-house, and said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have you got there, boys?
Jack-o'-lantern? Well, well. That's a
good one!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came up and looked at the pumpkin-glory,
and he bent back and he bent
forward, and he doubled down and he
straightened up, and laughed till the boys
thought he was going to kill himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had all intended to burst into
an Indian yell, and dance round the
pumpkin-glory; but the funniest papa
said, &lsquo;Now all you fellows keep still
half a minute,&rsquo; and the next thing they
knew he ran into the house, and came
out, walking his wife before him with
both his hands over her eyes. Then
the boys saw he was going to have
some fun with her, and they kept as
still as mice, and waited till he walked
her up to the pumpkin-glory; and she
was saying all the time, &lsquo;Now, John, if
this is some of your fooling, I'll <i>give</i>
it to you.&rsquo; When he got her close up
he took away his hands, and she gave a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
kind of a whoop, and then she began to
laugh, the pumpkin-glory <i>was</i> so funny,
and to chase the funniest papa all round
the yard to box his ears, and as soon as
she had boxed them she said, &lsquo;Now
let's go in and send the rest out,&rsquo; and in
about a quarter of a second all the other
papas came out, holding their hands
over the other mothers' eyes till they
got them up to the pumpkin-glory; and
then there was such a yelling and laughing
and chasing and ear-boxing that
you never heard anything like it; and
all at once the funniest papa hallooed
out: &lsquo;Where's gramma? Gramma's got
to see it! Grandma'll enjoy it. It's
just gramma's kind of joke,&rsquo; and then
the mothers all got round him and said
he shouldn't fool the grandmother, anyway;
and he said he wasn't going to:
he was just going to bring her out and
let her see it; and his wife went along
with him to watch that he didn't begin
acting up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The grandmother had been sitting
all alone in her room ever since dinner;
because she was always afraid somehow
that if you enjoyed yourself it was a
sign you were going to suffer for it, and
she had enjoyed herself a good deal
that day, and she was feeling awfully
about it. When the funniest papa and
his wife came in she said, &lsquo;What is it?
What is it? Is the world a-burnin' up?
Well, you got to wrap up warm, then,
or you'll ketch your death o' cold runnin'
and then stoppin' to rest with your
pores all open!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The funniest papa's wife she went
up and kissed her, and said, &lsquo;No, grandmother,
the world's all right,&rsquo; and then
she told her just how it was, and how
they wanted her to come out and see the
jack-o'-lantern, just to please the children;
and she must come, anyway; because
it was the funniest jack-o'-lantern
there ever was, and then she told how
the funniest papa had fooled her, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
then how they had got the other papas
to fool the other mothers, and they had
all had the greatest fun then you ever
saw. All the time she kept putting on
her things for her, and the grandmother
seemed to get quite in the notion, and
she laughed a little, and they thought
she was going to enjoy it as much as
anybody; they really did, because they
were all very tender of her, and they
wouldn't have scared her for anything,
and everybody kept cheering her up and
telling her how much they knew she
would like it, till they got her to the
pump. The little pumpkin-glory was
feeling awfully proud and self-satisfied;
for it had never seen any flower or any
vegetable treated with half so much
honor by human beings. It wasn't sure
at first that it was very nice to be laughed
at so much, but after a while it began
to conclude that the papas and the
mammas were just laughing at the joke
of the whole thing. When the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
grandmother got up close, it thought it
would do something extra to please her;
or else the heat of the candle had dried
it up so that it cracked without intending
to. Anyway, it tried to give a very
broad grin, and all of a sudden it split
its mouth from ear to ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn't say it had any ears before,&rdquo;
said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it had them behind,&rdquo; said the
papa; and the boy felt like giving him
just one pound; but he thought it might
stop the story, and so he let the papa
go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as the grandmother saw it
open its mouth that way she just gave
one scream, &lsquo;My sakes! It's comin' to
life!&rsquo; And she threw up her arms, and
she threw up her feet, and if the funniest
papa hadn't been there to catch her,
and if there hadn't been forty or fifty
other sons and daughters, and grandsons
and daughters, and great-grandsons and
great-granddaughters, very likely she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
might have fallen. As it was, they piled
round her, and kept her up; but there
were so many of them they jostled the
pump, and the first thing the pumpkin-glory
knew, it fell down and burst open;
and the pig that the boys had plagued,
and that had kept squealing all the time
because it thought that the people had
come out to feed it, knocked the loose
board off its pen, and flew out and gobbled
the pumpkin-glory up, candle and
all, and that was the end of the proud
little pumpkin-glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when the pig ate the candle it
looked like the magician when he puts
burning tow in his mouth,&rdquo; said the
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the papa.</p>

<p>The children were both silent for a
moment. Then the boy said, &ldquo;This story
never had any moral, I believe, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said the papa. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;the moral was that you had
better not be ambitious, unless you want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to come to the sad end of this proud
little pumpkin-glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, but the good little pumpkin
was eaten up, too,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; the papa acknowledged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the little girl, &ldquo;there's
a great deal of difference between being
eaten by persons and eaten by pigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the difference in the world,&rdquo; said
the papa; and he laughed, and ran out
of the library before the boy could get
at him.</p>

<p>One morning when the papa was on
a visit to the grandfather, the nephew
and the niece came rushing into his room
and got into bed with him. He pretended
to be asleep, and even when they
grabbed hold of him and shook him, he
just let his teeth clatter, and made no
sign of waking up. But they knew he
was fooling, and they kept shaking him
till he opened his eyes and looked round,
and said, &ldquo;Oh, oh! where am I?&rdquo; as if
he were all bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're in bed with <i>us</i>!&rdquo; they shouted;
and they acted as if they were
afraid he would try to get away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
them by the way they held on to his
arms.</p>

<p>But he lay quite still, and he only
said, &ldquo;I should say <i>you</i> were in bed with
<i>me</i>. It seems to be my bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's the same thing!&rdquo; said the
nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; asked
the papa. &ldquo;It's the same thing if it's
enchantment. But if it isn't, it isn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The niece said, &ldquo;What enchantment?&rdquo;
for she thought that would be a pretty
good chance to get what they had come
for.</p>

<p>She was perfectly delighted, and gave
a joyful thrill all over when the papa
said, &ldquo;Oh, that's a long story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the longer the better, <i>I</i> should
say; shouldn't you, brother?&rdquo; she returned.</p>

<p>The nephew hemmed twice in his
throat, and asked, drowsily, &ldquo;Is it a
little-pig story, or a fairy-prince story?&rdquo;
for he had heard from his cousins that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
their papa would tell you a little-pig
story if he got the chance; and you had
to look out and ask him which it was
going to be beforehand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can't tell,&rdquo; said the papa.
&ldquo;It's a fairy-prince story to begin with,
but it may turn out a little-pig story
before it gets to the end. It depends
upon how the Prince behaves. But <i>I'm</i>
not anxious to tell it,&rdquo; and the papa put
his face into the pillow and pretended
to fall instantly asleep again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, brother, you see!&rdquo; said the
niece. &ldquo;Being so particular!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sister,&rdquo; said the nephew, &ldquo;it
wasn't my fault. I <i>had</i> to ask him.
You know what they said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we've got to wake
him up all over again,&rdquo; said the niece,
with a little sigh; and they began
to pull at the papa this way and that,
but they could not budge him. As
soon as they stopped, he opened his
eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don't say, &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo;&rdquo;
said the niece.</p>

<p>The papa could not help laughing, because
that was just the very thing he
was going to say. &ldquo;Well, all right!
What about that story? Do you want
to hear it, and take your chances of its
being a Prince to the end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we'll have to; won't we,
sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we'll leave it all to you, uncle,&rdquo;
said the niece; and she thought she
would coax him up a little, and so she
went on: &ldquo;I know you won't be mean
about it. Will he, brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the nephew. &ldquo;I'll bet
the Prince will keep a Prince all the
way through. What'll <i>you</i> bet, sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't bet anything,&rdquo; said the
niece, and she put her arm round the
papa's neck, and pressed her cheek up
against his. &ldquo;I'll just leave it to uncle,
and if it <i>does</i> turn into a little-pig story,
it'll be for the moral.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The nephew was not quite sure what
a moral was; but at the bottom of his
heart he would just as soon have it a
little-pig story as not. He had got to
thinking how funny a little pig would
look in a Prince's clothes, and he said,
&ldquo;Yes, it'll be for the moral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The papa was very contrary that
morning. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don't
know about that. I'm not sure there's
going to be any moral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goody!&rdquo; said the niece, and she
clapped her hands in great delight.
&ldquo;Then it's going to be a Prince story
all through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you interrupt me in that way, it's
not going to be any story at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't know you had begun it,
uncle,&rdquo; pleaded the niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hadn't. But I was just going
to.&rdquo; The papa lay quiet a while.
The fact is, he had not thought up any
story at all; and he was so tired of all
the stories he used to tell his own chil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>dren
that he could not bear to tell one
of them, though he knew very well
that the niece and nephew would be
just as glad of it as if it were new, and
maybe gladder; for they had heard a
great deal about these stories, how perfectly
splendid they were&mdash;like the
Pumpkin-Glory, and the Little Pig that
took the Poison Pills, and the Proud
Little Horse-car that fell in Love with
the Pullman Sleeper, and Jap Doll
Hopsing's Adventures in Crossing the
Continent, and the Enchantment of the
Greedy Travellers, and the Little Boy
whose Legs turned into Bicycle Wheels.
At last the papa said, &ldquo;This is a very
peculiar kind of a story. It's about a
Prince and a Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; went both of the children;
and then they stopped themselves, and
stuffed the covering into their mouths.</p>

<p>The papa lifted himself on his elbow
and stared severely at them, first at one,
and then at the other. &ldquo;Have you fin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>ished?&rdquo;
he asked, as if they had interrupted
him; but he really wanted to
gain time, so as to think up a story of
some kind. The children were afraid
to say anything, and the papa went on
with freezing politeness: &ldquo;Because if
you have, I might like to say something
myself. This story is about a Prince
and a Princess, but the thing of it is
that they had names almost exactly
alike. They were twins; the Prince
was a boy and the Princess was a girl;
that was a point that their fairy godmother
carried against the wicked enchantress
who tried to have it just the
other way; but it made the wicked enchantress
so mad that the fairy godmother
had to give in to her a little, and
let them be named almost exactly alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the papa stopped, and after
waiting for him to go on, the nephew
ventured to ask, very respectfully indeed,
&ldquo;Would you mind telling us what
their names were, uncle?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The papa rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;I
have such a bad memory for names.
Hold on! Wait a minute! I remember
now! Their names were Butterflyflutterby
and Flutterbybutterfly.&rdquo; Of
course he had just thought up the names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And which was which, uncle dear?&rdquo;
asked the niece, not only very respectfully,
but very affectionately, too; she
was so afraid he would get mad again,
and stop altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I should think you would
know a girl's name when you heard it.
Butterflyflutterby was the Prince and
Flutterbybutterfly was the Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how we're ever going to
keep them apart,&rdquo; sighed the niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've <i>got</i> to keep them apart,&rdquo;
said the papa. &ldquo;Because it's the great
thing about the story that if you can't
remember which is the Prince and which
is the Princess whenever I ask you, the
story has to stop. It can't help it, and
<i>I</i> can't help it.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>They knew he was just setting a trap
for them, and the same thought struck
them both at once. They rose up and
leaned over the papa, with their arms
across and their fluffy heads together
in the form of a capital letter A, and
whispered in each other's ears, &ldquo;You
say it's one, and I'll say it's the other,
and then we'll have it right between
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They dropped back and pulled the
covering up to their chins, and shouted,
&ldquo;Don't you tell! don't you tell!&rdquo; and
just perfectly wriggled with triumph.</p>

<p>The papa had heard every word;
they were laughing so that they whispered
almost as loud as talking; but he
pretended that he had not understood,
and he made up his mind that he would
have them yet. &ldquo;A little and a more,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and I should never have gone
on again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo; they called out,
and then they wriggled and giggled till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
anybody would have thought they were
both crazy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where was I?&rdquo; This was another
of the papa's tricks to gain time.
Whenever he could not think of anything
more, he always asked, &ldquo;Well,
where was I?&rdquo; He now added: &ldquo;Oh
yes! I remember! Well, once there
were a Prince and a Princess, and their
names were Butterflyflutterby and Flutterbybutterfly;
and they were both
twins, and both orphans; but they made
their home with their fairy godmother
as long as they were little, and they
used to help her about the house for
part board, and she helped them about
their kingdom, and kept it in good order
for them, and left them plenty of
time to play and enjoy themselves. She
was the greatest person for order there
ever was; and if she found a speck of
dust or dirt on the kingdom anywhere,
she would have out the whole army
and make them wash it up, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sand-paper the place, and polish it with
a coarse towel till it perfectly glistened.
The father of the Prince and Princess
had taken the precaution, before he
died, to subdue all his enemies; and the
consequence was that the longest kind
of peace had set in, and the army had
nothing to do but keep the kingdom
clean. That was the reason why the
fairy godmother had made the General-in-Chief
take their guns away, and
arm them with long feather-dusters.
They marched with the poles on their
shoulders, and carried the dusters in
their belts, like bayonets; and whenever
they came to a place that the fairy godmother
said needed dusting&mdash;she always
went along with them in a diamond
chariot&mdash;she made the General
halloo out: &lsquo;Fix dusters! Make ready!
Aim! Dust!&rsquo; And then the place
would be cleaned up. But the General-in-Chief
used to go out behind the
church and cry, it mortified him so to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
have to give such orders, and it reminded
him so painfully of the good
old times when he would order his men
to charge the enemy, and cover the field
with gore and blood, instead of having
it so awfully spick-and-span as it was
now. Still he did what the fairy godmother
told him, because he said it was
his duty; and he kept his troops supplied
with sudsine and dustene, to clean
up with, and brushes and towels. The
fairy godmother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, uncle,&rdquo; said the nephew,
with extreme deference, &ldquo;but I should
just like to ask you one question. Will
you let me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the papa, in the
grimmest kind of manner he could put
on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, brother!&rdquo; murmured the niece;
for she knew that he was rather sarcastic,
and she was afraid that something
ironical was coming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I just wanted to ask whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
this story was about the fairy godmother,
or about the Prince and Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, now,&rdquo; said the papa.
&ldquo;You've asked your question. I didn't
promise to answer it, and I'm happy to
say it stops the story. I'll guess <i>I'll</i> go
to sleep again. I don't like being waked
up this way in the middle of the night,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, brother, I hope you're satisfied!&rdquo;
said the niece.</p>

<p>The nephew evaded the point. He
said: &ldquo;Well, sister, if the story really
isn't going on, I should like to ask
uncle another question. How big was
the fairy godmother's diamond chariot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the usual sized chariot,&rdquo; answered
the papa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! It must have been a pretty
big diamond, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a <i>very</i> big diamond,&rdquo; said
the papa; and he seemed to forget all
about being mad, or else he had thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
up some more of the story to tell, for
he went on just as if nothing had happened.
&ldquo;The fairy godmother was so
severe with the dirt she found because
it was a royal prerogative&mdash;that is, nobody
but the King, or the King's family,
had a right to make a mess, and if
other people did it, they were infringing
on the royal prerogative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the papa explained,
&ldquo;that in old times and countries the
royal family have been allowed to do
things that no other family would have
been associated with if they had done
them. That is about the only use there
is in having a royal family. But the
fairy godmother of Prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Butterflyflutterby,&rdquo; said the niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Princess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flutterbybutterfly,&rdquo; said the nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; said the papa.</p>

<p>The children rose up into a capital A
again, and whispered, &ldquo;He didn't catch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
us <i>that</i> time,&rdquo; and fell back, laughing,
and the papa had to go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fairy godmother thought she
would try to bring up the Prince and
Princess rather better than most Princes
and Princesses were brought up, and so
she said that the only thing they should
be allowed to do different from other
people was to make a mess. If any
other persons were caught making a
mess they were banished; and there
was another law that was perfectly awful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What-was-it-go-ahead?&rdquo; said the
nephew, running all his words together,
he was so anxious to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if any person was found clearing
up anywhere, and it turned out to
be a mess that the royal twins had
made, the person was thrown from a
tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it kill them?&rdquo; the niece inquired,
rather faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, it didn't <i>kill</i> them exact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ly,
but it bounced them up pretty high.
You see, they fell on a bed of India-rubber
about twenty feet deep. It gave
them a good scare; and that's the great
thing in throwing persons from a high
tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nephew hastened to improve the
opportunity which seemed to be given
for asking questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean exactly by making
a mess, uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, scattering scraps of paper about,
or scuffing the landscape, or getting jam
or molasses on the face of nature, or
having bonfires in the back yard of the
palace, or leaving dolls around on the
throne. But what did I say about asking
questions? Now there's another
thing about this story: when it comes
to the exciting part, if you move the
least bit, or even breathe loud, the story
stops, just as if you didn't know which
was the Prince and which was the Princess.
<i>Now</i> do you understand?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>The children both said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in a
very small whisper, and cowered down
almost under the clothing, and held on
tight, so as to keep from
stirring.</p>

</div>

<p>The papa went
on: &ldquo;Well,
about the
time they
had got
these two
laws in full
force, and
forty or
fifty thousand
boys
girls had been
banished for making
a mess, and pretty
nearly all the neat
old ladies in the kingdom
had been thrown
from a high tower
for cleaning up after the Prince and Princess
Butterflyflutterby and Flutterby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>butterfly,
the young Khan and Khant of
Tartary entered the kingdom with a
magnificent retinue of followers, to select
a bride and groom from the children
of the royal family. As there were no
children in the royal family except the
twins, the choice of the Khan and Khant
naturally fell upon the Prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Butterflyflutterby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Princess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flutterbybutterfly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Correct. It also happened that the
Khan and the Khant were brother and
sister; but if you can't tell which was
the brother and which was the sister,
the story stops at this point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, but, uncle,&rdquo; said the little girl,
reproachfully, &ldquo;you haven't ever told
us which is which yourself yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. Because I'm waiting to
find out. You see, with these Asiatic
names it's impossible sometimes to tell
which is which. You have to wait and
see how they will act. If there had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
been a battle anywhere, and one of
them had screamed, and run away, then
I suppose I should have been pretty
sure it was the sister; but even then I
shouldn't know which was the Khan
and which was the Khant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we going to do about
it, then?&rdquo; asked the nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said the papa. &ldquo;We
shall just have to keep on and see. Perhaps
when they meet the Prince and
Princess we shall find out. I don't suppose
a boy would fall in love with a
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the niece; &ldquo;but he might
want to go off with him and have fun,
or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said the papa. &ldquo;We've
got to all watch out. Of course the
Khan and the Khant scuffed the landscape
awfully, as they came along
through the kingdom, and got the face
of nature all daubed up with marmalade&mdash;they
were the greatest persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
for marmalade&mdash;and when they reached
the palace of the Prince and Princess
they had to camp out in the back yard,
and they had to have bonfires to cook
by, and they made a frightful mess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there was the greatest excitement
about it that there ever was. The
General-in-Chief kept his men under
arms night and day, and the fairy godmother
was so worked up she almost
had a brain-fever; and if she had not
taken six of aconite every night when
she went to bed she <i>would</i> have had.
You see, the question was what to do
about the mess that the Khan and
Khant made. They were visitors, and
it wouldn't have been polite to banish
them; and they belonged to a royal
family, and so nobody dared to clean up
after them. The whole kingdom was
in the most disgusting state, and whenever
the fairy godmother looked into
the back yard of the palace she felt as
if she would go through the floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it kept on going from bad to
worse. The only person that enjoyed
herself was the wicked enchantress; <i>she</i>
never had such a good time in her life;
and when the fairy godmother got hold
of the Grand Vizier and the Cadi, and
told them to make a new law so as to
allow the army to clean up after royal
visitors, without being thrown from a
high tower, the wicked enchantress enchanted
the whole mess, so that the
army could not tell which the Prince
and Princess had made, and which the
Khan and Khant had made; they were
all four always playing together, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed as if the poor old fairy
godmother would go perfectly wild, and
she almost made the General crazy giving
orders in one breath, and taking
them back in the next. She said that
now something had got to be done; she
had stood it long enough; and she was
going to take the case into her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
hands. She saw that she should have
no peace of her life till the Prince and
Princess and the Khan and Khant were
married. She sent for the head Imam,
and told him to bring those children
right in and marry them, and she would
be responsible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Imam put his head to the floor&mdash;and
it was pretty hard on him, for he
was short and stout, and he had to do
it kind of sideways&mdash;and said to hear
was to obey; but he could not marry
them unless he knew which was which.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fairy godmother screamed out:
&lsquo;I don't <i>care</i> which is which! Marry
them all, just as they are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when she came to think it over,
she saw that this would not do, and so
she tried to invent some way out of the
trouble. One morning she woke up
with a splendid idea, and she could
hardly wait to have breakfast before
she sent for the General-in-Chief. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
nerves were all gone, and as soon as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
saw him, she yelled at him: &lsquo;A sham
battle&mdash;to-day&mdash;now&mdash;this very instant!
Right away, right away, right
away!&rsquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;THE IMAM PUT HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The General got her to explain herself,
and then he understood that she
wanted him to have a grand review and
sham battle of all the troops, in honor
of the Khan and Khant; and the whole
court had to be present, and especially
the timidest of the ladies, that would
almost scare a person to death by the
way they screamed when they were
frightened. The General was just going
to say that the guns and cannon
had all got rusty, and the powder was
spoiled from not having been used for
so long, with the everlasting cleaning up
that had been going on; but the fairy
godmother stamped her foot and sent
him flying. So the only thing he could
do was to set all the gnomes at work
making guns and cannon and powder,
and about twelve o'clock they had them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
ready, and just after lunch the sham
battle began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The troops marched and counter-marched,
and fired away the whole afternoon,
and sprang mines and blew up
magazines, and threw cannon crackers
and cannon torpedoes. There was such
an awful din and racket that you couldn't
hear yourself think, and some of the
court ladies were made perfectly sick by
it. They all asked to be excused, but
the fairy godmother wouldn't excuse
one of them. She just kept them there
on the seats round the battle-field, and
let them shriek themselves hoarse. So
many of them fainted that they had to
have the garden hose brought, and they
kept it sprinkling away on their faces
all the afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;"><a name="illus_13" id="illus_13"></a>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;THEY BEGAN TO SCREAM, &lsquo;OH, THE COW! THE COW!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But it was a failure as far as the
Khan and the Khant were concerned.
The fairy godmother expected that as
soon as the loudest firing began, the
girl, whichever it was, would scream,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and so they would know which was
which. But the Khan and Khant's father
had been a famous warrior, and he
had been in the habit of taking his children
to battle with him from their earliest
years, partly because his wife was
dead and he didn't dare trust them
with the careless nurse at home, and
partly because he wanted to harden
their nerves. So now they just clapped
their hands, and enjoyed the sham battle
down to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About sunset the fairy godmother
gave it up. She had to, anyway. The
troops had shot away all their powder,
and the gnomes couldn't make any more
till the next day. So she set out to return
to the city, with all the court following
her diamond chariot, and I can
tell you she felt pretty gloomy. She
told the Grand Vizier that now she
didn't see any end to the trouble, and
she was just going into hysterics when
a barefooted boy came along driving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
his cow home from the pasture. The
fairy godmother didn't mind it much,
for she was in her chariot; but the
court ladies were on foot, and they began
to scream, &lsquo;Oh, the cow! the cow!&rsquo;
and to take hold of the knights, and to
get on to the fence, till it was perfectly
packed with them; and who do you
think the fairy godmother found had
scrambled up on top of her chariot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nephew and niece were afraid to
risk a guess, and the papa had to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Khant! The fairy godmother
pulled her inside and hugged her and
kissed her, she was so glad to find out
that she was the one; and she stopped
the procession on the spot, and she called
up the Imam, and he married the Khant
to Prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The papa stopped, and as the niece
and nephew hesitated, he said, very
sternly, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact is, they had got so mixed up
about the Khan and the Khant of Tar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>tary
that they had forgotten which was
Butterflyflutterby and which was Flutterbybutterfly.
They tried, shouting
out one the one and the other the other,
but the papa said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! That won't work. I've
had that sort of thing tried on me before,
and it <i>never</i> works. <i>I</i> heard you
whispering what you would do, and you
have simply added the crime of double-dealing
to the crime of inattention. The
story has stopped, and stopped forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nephew stretched himself and
then sat up in bed. &ldquo;Well, it had got
to the end, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>had</i> it? What became of the
wicked enchantress?&rdquo; The nephew lay
down again, in considerable dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said the niece, very coaxingly,
&ldquo;<i>I</i> didn't say it had come to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it has,&rdquo; said the papa. &ldquo;And
I'm mighty glad you forgot the Prince's
name, for the rule of this story is that
it has to go on as long as any one listen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ing
remembers, and it might have gone
on forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; the nephew said, &ldquo;a person
may guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may, if he guesses right. If he
guesses wrong, he has to be thrown from
a high tower&mdash;the same one the wicked
enchantress was thrown from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; shouted the nephew; &ldquo;you
said you wouldn't tell. How high was
the tower, anyway, uncle? As high as
the Eiffel Tower in Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite. It was three feet and
five inches high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Then the enchantress was a
dwarf!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said she was a dwarf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There wouldn't be any use throwing
her from the tower if she wasn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't say it was any use. They
just did it for ornament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This made the nephew so mad that
he began to dig the papa with his fist,
and the papa began to laugh. He said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
as well as he could for laughing: &ldquo;You
see, the trouble was to keep her from
bouncing up higher than the top of the
tower. She was light weight, anyway,
because she was a witch; and after the
first bounce they had to have two executioners
to keep throwing her down&mdash;a
day executioner and a night executioner;
and she went so fast up and
down that she was just like a solid column
of enchantress. She enjoyed it first-rate,
but it kept her out of mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, uncle,&rdquo; said the niece, &ldquo;you're
just letting yourself go. What did the
fairy godmother do after they all got
married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the story don't say exactly.
But there's a report that when she became
a fairy grandgodmother, she was
not half so severe about cleaning up, and
let the poor old General-in-Chief have
some peace of his life&mdash;or some war.
There was a rebellion among the genii
not long afterwards, and the General was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
about ten or fifteen years putting them
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nephew had been lying quiet a
moment. Now he began to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded
his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way that Khant scrambled up
on top of the chariot when the cow
came along. Just like a girl. They're
all afraid of cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tears came into the niece's eyes;
she had a great many feelings, and they
were easily hurt, especially her feelings
about girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she wasn't afraid of the cannon,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a very just remark,&rdquo; said the
uncle. &ldquo;And now what do you say to
breakfast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children sprang out of bed, and
tried which could beat to the door.
They forgot to thank the uncle, but he
did not seem to have expected any
thanks.</p>
